                        <h2>Understanding CC Traffic</h2>
                        <p>CC Traffic stands for call center traffic which is the setup of calls that are routed through a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) or telephony network, specifically dedicated to call center operations. The majority of traffic can be inbound (customer ring to call center) or outbound (call center ring out to consumer, lead). CC Traffic is an essential part of business communications for businesses that work with customer support or telemarketers and uses it for lead generation.</p>

                        <h2>Businesses have a few metrics that they use to assess the efficiency of CC Traffic:</h2>
                        <p><strong>Answer-Seizure Ratio (ASR)</strong>  — the ratio of calls connected to calls attempted The ASR (Automatic Speech recognition) should be high to have all the calls routed accurately.</p>
                        <p><strong>Average Call Duration (ACD):</strong>Average time taken to call. Longer durations can also mean clunky conversations, and are thus typically inferred as lack of engagement.</p>
                        <p><strong>Post-Dial Delay (PDD):</strong> The time lag between dialing a number, and hearing the first ring A lower PDD ensures that customers get connected for complaint resolution quicker, therefore, offering an improved customer experience.</p>
                        <p><strong>Call Completion Rate (CCR):</strong> The percentage of calls that reach a successful outcome (e.g., answered by a live agent).</p>
