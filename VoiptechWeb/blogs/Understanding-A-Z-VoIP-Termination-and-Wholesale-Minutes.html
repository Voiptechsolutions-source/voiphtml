                        <h2>What is VoIP Termination?</h2>
                        <p>VoIP termination refers to the process of routing calls from a VoIP network to a traditional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or mobile networks. Essentially, it’s the final step in the VoIP calling process, where calls are “terminated” on the recipient’s phone. This is where the call is handed over from the internet to the receiver’s network, allowing the caller to talk with anyone, anywhere in the world.</p>

                        <h2>What Does "A-Z" VoIP Termination Mean?</h2>
                        <p>The term A-Z VoIP termination refers to the full, end-to-end service that allows VoIP calls to be routed from one network to another, all the way to the final destination. The "A" stands for the origin of the call, and the "Z" represents the end point—the recipient of the call. A-Z termination encompasses all the steps involved in delivering a call to the recipient, from the initial dialing to the final connection.</p>
                        <p>This is where wholesale VoIP providers come in. They offer A-Z VoIP termination by interconnecting with multiple carriers and networks across the globe to ensure that calls reach their destination efficiently and at the lowest possible cost.</p>

                        <h2>What Are Wholesale VoIP Minutes?</h2>
                        <p>Wholesale VoIP minutes are bulk call minutes bought and sold between providers, typically at discounted rates. Businesses or service providers purchase these wholesale minutes to reduce their communication costs while maintaining high-quality voice services. These minutes are used for call termination, connecting international and local calls at a fraction of the price charged by traditional telecom companies.</p>

                                The main benefit of wholesale minutes is the cost savings. Because
                                businesses buy minutes in bulk, the per-minute cost is much lower compared
                                to retail VoIP rates. This helps businesses save money, especially when
                                making a large volume of calls.</li>

                                carriers and global networks. A-Z VoIP termination ensures that the calls
                                are clear and reliable.</li>

                                Whether you're a small business or a large corporation, wholesale VoIP
                                services allow you to scale up or down based on your specific needs. You
