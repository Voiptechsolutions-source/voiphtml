                        <h2>Network Resilience</h2>
                        <p> One of the key advantages of VoIP is its reliance on internet connectivity rather than traditional phone lines. Most VoIP systems operate through the internet, which can often remain functional even when conventional networks go down. As long as there’s access to a Wi-Fi connection or mobile data, users can make calls and send messages, maintaining essential lines of communication.</p>
